# algo-complexity-viz

In this project I wanted to show how sorting algo complexity can change depending on the initial dataset in the particular case of sorting algorithms.
I took bubble, selection, insertion, quick, radix and merge sort for the benchmark.<br>
The vizualisation is done with the Chart.js lib
